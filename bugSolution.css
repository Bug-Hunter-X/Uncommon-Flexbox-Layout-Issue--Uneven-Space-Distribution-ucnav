The issue was resolved by ensuring that the parent container had a defined height and that all child elements had a minimum width set to prevent the container from collapsing.  The correct use of `flex-grow` was also verified. Here's the corrected CSS code:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  height: 300px; /* Defined height is crucial */
  justify-content: space-around;
}

.item {
  flex-grow: 1;
  min-width: 100px; /* Prevents collapse */
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 10px;
}
```
